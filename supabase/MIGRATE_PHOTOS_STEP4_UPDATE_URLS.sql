-- ========================================
-- STEP 4: UPDATE PHOTO URLS IN DATABASE
-- ========================================
-- 
-- This script updates all venue photo URLs to point to the production
-- storage instead of the development storage.
--
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT: Only run this AFTER successfully migrating photos in Step 3!
--
-- üîß HOW TO RUN:
-- 1. Ensure Step 3 (photo migration) completed successfully
-- 2. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/udpygouyogrwvwjbzdul/sql/new
-- 3. Copy and paste this script
-- 4. Click "RUN" to execute
--

-- Step 1: Preview what will be changed (DRY RUN)
SELECT 
  'üîç DRY RUN - PREVIEW OF CHANGES' as preview,
  v.id as venue_id,
  v.name as venue_name,
  v.photos as old_photos_array,
  -- Show what the new array will look like
  ARRAY(
    SELECT replace(
      photo_url, 
      'https://lnoaurqbnmxbsfaahnjw.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/venue-photos/',
      'https://udpygouyogrwvwjbzdul.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/venue-photos/'
    )
    FROM unnest(v.photos) as photo_url
  ) as new_photos_array
FROM venues v
WHERE v.photos IS NOT NULL 
  AND array_length(v.photos, 1) > 0
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM unnest(v.photos) as photo_url 
    WHERE photo_url LIKE '%lnoaurqbnmxbsfaahnjw%'
  )
ORDER BY v.name;

-- Step 2: Count how many venues will be affected
SELECT 
  'üìä IMPACT ANALYSIS' as analysis,
  COUNT(*) as venues_to_update,
  SUM(array_length(photos, 1)) as total_photos_to_update
FROM venues 
WHERE photos IS NOT NULL 
  AND array_length(photos, 1) > 0
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM unnest(photos) as photo_url 
    WHERE photo_url LIKE '%lnoaurqbnmxbsfaahnjw%'
  );

-- Step 3: Backup current state (optional but recommended)
-- Create a backup table with current URLs
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS venues_photo_backup AS 
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  photos,
  now() as backup_timestamp
FROM venues 
WHERE photos IS NOT NULL 
  AND array_length(photos, 1) > 0
  AND EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM unnest(photos) as photo_url 
    WHERE photo_url LIKE '%lnoaurqbnmxbsfaahnjw%'
  );

SELECT 
  'üíæ BACKUP CREATED' as backup_status,
  COUNT(*) as venues_backed_up
FROM venues_photo_backup;

-- Step 4: Confirm before proceeding
-- Uncomment the next section ONLY after reviewing the preview above
-- and confirming that Step 3 (photo migration) completed successfully
